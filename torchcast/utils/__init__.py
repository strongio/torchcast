"""
The data-utils in this module are useful for converting time-series data from a Pandas DataFrame into a PyTorch
:class:`torch.utils.data.Dataset` and/or :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. The most common pattern is using the
``from_dataframe()`` classmethod.

Additionally, utility functions are provided for handling missing data and adding calendar-features (i.e.
weekly/daily/yearly season dummy-features that can be passed to any neural-network).
