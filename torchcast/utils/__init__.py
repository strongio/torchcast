"""
This module includes:

* Data-utils, such as those for converting time-series data from a Pandas DataFrame into a PyTorch
  :class:`torch.utils.data.Dataset` and/or :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, as well as a function for handling
  implicit missing data.
* A function for adding calendar-features: i.e. weekly/daily/yearly season dummy-features for usage as predictors.
* A function for creating a simple baseline model, against which to compare more sophisticated forecasting models.
* Simple trainer classes for PyTorch models, with specialized subclasses for torchcast's model-classes, as well as a
  special class for training neural networks to embed complex seasonal patterns into lower dimensional embeddings.
